# Creating a new resource
1. Create an empty post from: 
    * Dev site: http://cstechno-sitedev.swansea.ac.uk/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_type=x-portfolio
    * Live site: http://www.technocamps.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_type=x-portfolio
2. Insert workshop title
3. Check the permalink below the title is appropriate and tweak as needed. Shorter is better
4. Add appropriate tags based on the workshop topics
    * E.g. scratch, python, unplugged, etc.
    * Click the button below to check what tags other people have been using
5. Select appropriate category
    * Celect which learner level itâ€™s aimed at e.g. School Level > Secondary > 11+
    * If this workshops is also part of a programme, create and/or select that category as well. If in doubt, ask Joe.
    * Multiple categories can be selected if appropriate
6. Uploading materials
    * Scroll down to the "**Media**" section of the editor and select "**Add Media**"
    * Create a folder for your resources within "**Resources**" e.g. "**Resources > Getting started with Scratch**"
    * If this workshops is within a programme, put it within that program e.g. "**Resources >  CS101 > Py Shop**"
    * Ensure your material files are named sensibly
	e.g. "**workshop_name_presentation_v1**", "**workshop_name_workbook_v2**", etc.
    * Select the newly updated media files and insert into post
    * Remove the material links from the article body, and ensure they're still present in the **Media** settings section
7. Feature image
    * Create a landscape preview image for the resource
    * Ideal resolution is 1200 x 628 or 1.91:1
    * Upload your the featured image to the same folder as the resources with with a name something like "**workshop_name_thumbnail**"
    * Attach featured image to the post.
8. Save and check, double check, tripple check.
